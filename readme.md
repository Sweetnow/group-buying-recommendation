## Group-Buying Recommendation for Social E-Commerce

This is the official implementation of the paper ***Group-Buying Recommendation for Social E-Commerce*** [(PDF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06848) accepted by ICDE'2021.


### Group-Buying Dataset

**Group buying**, as an emerging form of purchase
in social e-commerce websites, such as Pinduoduo.com
, has recently
achieved great success. In this new business model, users, *initiator*,
can launch a group and share products to their social networks,
and when there are enough friends, *participants*, join it, the
deal is clinched. Group-buying recommendation for social ecommerce, which recommends an item list when users want to
launch a group, plays an important role in the group success ratio
and sales.

The information about the dataset can be found in `BeiBei/readme.txt`.

### Code

We separate model definition from the framework `librecframework` for easily understanding.

You can find the framework `librecframework` in https://github.com/Sweetnow/librecframework.

Both modules mentioned in `requirements.txt` and `librecframework` should be installed before running the code.

More details about our codes will be added soon.
