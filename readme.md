### Code

We separate model definition from the framework `librecframework` for easily understanding.

You can find the framework `librecframework` in https://github.com/Sweetnow/librecframework.

Both modules mentioned in `requirements.txt` and `librecframework` should be installed before running the code.

More details about our codes will be added soon.
